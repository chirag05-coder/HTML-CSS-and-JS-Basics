   <h4>
     The Meteor represents the eternal essence of riding, the spirit of the cruise; with classic contours & timeless design cues, it is an easy thoroughbred cruiser, ready for the open highway and for meeting the challenges of urban commute with equal ease.
    Growing up in the 1980s meant that the lasting image of a motorcycle for me was a cruiser of some sort. It’s not that I was a ‘cruiser guy’, it’s just that when you see lots of something, that becomes the main frame of reference, and desire in this case! Evolving from a diet of bicycles into my late teens, I was quite mesmerised by the idea of a quintessential American style cruiser - and the first one that I actually saw in the flesh and instantly fell in love with was the Royal Enfield Citybike.

      <h4>An old-school, post-war design built around an engine that you can count on. That's Classic, the machine that bears on simple pleasures of motorcycling, while being dependable enough to ride through any terrain. In it, the tradition of an iconic past exists in harmony with modern technology. Timeless, looking through tomorrow.
        Royal Enfield Classic 350 and Classic 500 are models of Royal Enfield motorcycles which have been in production since 2009.

Both the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 feature the new unit construction engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively. However the Classic 350 uses a carburettor for fuel delivery and the Classic 500 has EFI. The Classic 350 has an ammeter while the Classic 500 has a low fuel indicator light and engine check light instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on the Classic 350 is more of a vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use for it.
